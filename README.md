# SnakeHunt
Multiplayer Javascript game made with NodeJS

Link: https://snakehunt.herokuapp.com/

## How To Play
- At least 2 players need to connect to the game to start
- Press the space key to begin the game
- Using the WASD or arrow keys, move your snake around the map
- Avoid dying by not hitting the walls or other players in the game
- You gets points for the longer you survive (1 point for each other player outlived)
- Your length gets longer over time to increase the difficulty
- Winner has the most points by the end of the game, good luck!

## How It Was Made
This game uses HTML, CSS and Javascript - it is hosted using Node.js and the graphics where created using p5.js. 

It is being hosted on Keroku but all the files have been transfered to the GitHub page as well. 

## Why Was It Made

This was a small project I did to learn Node.js and to practice using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

It gave me an introduction to programming projects on a larger scale across multiple files as well as how to structure my code so that it is more easily maintainable. 

I also learnt more about back-end web development which allowed me to host web servers remotely so that they can be accessed by anyone. 

## What Could Be Improved

The graphics are very minimal as most of my time was spent learning how to host the game on a server. If I had more time I would try and improve the graphics and implement more realistic sprites.

The game also lags when multiple people join - this is probably due to the fact that my server script can't handle many requests at once. To improve I would spend more time looking into how to optimise the server code so that it can better handle multiple players.  

## Conclusion

Overall, this was a very fun game to make and I learnt many new skills. I am moving on to learn more front-end web development using React JS and hopefully I can combine these 2 skills in the future to improve this project.
